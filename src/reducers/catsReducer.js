// We also set up the initial state here
// We can see that in the 'LOADING_CATS' case, state.loading becomes true
// while the rest of state is just copied to a new object.
// In the 'ADD_CATS' case, state.loading becomes false,
//  and state.cats is set to the action.cats payload
//  (HINT: so we know we're expecting a payload object with a cats key)
